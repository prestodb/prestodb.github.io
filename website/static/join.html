        <h3 id="what-is-the-presto-foundation">What is the Presto Foundation?</h3>

        <p>
            The Presto Foundation is the organization that oversees the
            development of the <a href="https://prestodb.io">Presto open source
            project</a>. Members of the Presto Foundation provide essential
            financial support for the collaborative development process,
            including tooling, infrastructure, and community conferences.

        <h3 id="where-is-the-presto-foundation-hosted">Where is the Presto Foundation hosted?</h3>

        <p>
            The Presto Foundation is hosted at
            <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org">the Linux Foundation</a>, the
            non-profit which hosts the Linux kernel and many other open source
            projects. Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more
            than 1,000 members and is the worldâ€™s leading home for collaboration
            on open source software, open standards, open data, and open
            hardware.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-presto-foundation-will-enable-open-governance">How will the
        Presto Foundation enable neutral governance for Presto?</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/presto-interacting-with-petabytes-of-data-at-facebook/10151786197628920/">Presto was developed at Facebook</a>
            in 2012 as a high-performance distributed SQL query engine for large
            scale data analytics. Presto Foundation will operate under a
            community governance model with representation from each of the
            founding members. With this evolution Facebook will be collaborating
            with the broader ecosystem of users and contributors as one voice in
            the future of the Foundation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="governing-body">What are the governing bodies?</h3>

        <p>
            The Presto Foundation has two main governing bodies: The Governing
            Board, and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
        </p>


        <p>
            The <strong>Governing Board</strong> manages the Presto Foundation's
            funding in support of the Presto open source project. Organizations
            become members and pay dues, which the Governing Board then
            allocates. Premier members are entitled to appoint a representative
            to the Governing Board, and participate directly in funding
            decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>TSC</strong> manages the open source development
            process, and is responsible for technical oversight of the project.
            This means continuing the development of Presto as an open source
            distributed SQL query engine, but also developing documentation,
            testing, integration, and the creation of artifacts that aid the
            development process. While the TSC is open for any observer to
            participate, any contributor to the open source project may, through
            time, experience, and wise decision-making, be selected by their
            peers to be a voting member of the TSC.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to note that while participation on the
            <strong>Governing Board</strong> is limited to Presto Foundation
            members, anyone may earn the right to lead the <strong>TSC</strong>,
            regardless of their membership status.
        <p>

        <h2 id="join">Become a member</h2>

        <h3 id="membership-categories">What are the different types of Presto
           Foundation membership?</h3>

        <p>
            The Presto Foundation has two membership levels: Premier, and
            Associate.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Premier members</strong> are entitled to appoint a
            representative to the Presto Foundation Governing Board and any
            Presto Foundation committees. In this way, Premier members are
            directly involved in policy and funding allocation decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Associate members</strong> are limited to Associate Members
            of the Linux Foundation.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the requirements to become a member?</h3>

        <p>
            To become a member in the Presto Foundation, an organization must
            also be a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/">
            member of the Linux Foundation</a>. Organizations can become members
            in the Linux Foundation first, or both simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
            Premier membership in the Presto Foundation is $10k annually, in
            addition to Linux Foundation membership.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no cost for Associate membership for qualifying
            organizations.
        </p>
