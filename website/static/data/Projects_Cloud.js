Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you&nbsp;run. <br /><br /> Amazon Athena uses Presto with full standard SQL support and works with a variety of standard data formats. Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema&nbsp;versioning.
