    "description": "Presto on AWS Journey at Twilio - Lesson Learned and Optimization - Aakash Pradeep & Badri Tripathy, Twilio\n\nTwilio as a leader in cloud communication platforms is very heavy on data and data-based decision making. Most data related use cases are currently powered by the Presto engine. Two years back we started the Journey with Presto in Twilio and today the system has scaled to a multi-PB data lakehouse and supports more than 75k queries per day. In this journey, we learned a lot about how to effectively operationalize Presto on AWS and some of the tricks to have better query reliability, query performance, guard-railing the clusters and save cost. With this talk, we want to share this experience with the community.",

    "description": "Customer-Facing Presto at Rippling - Andy Li, Rippling\n\nPresto is used for a variety of cases, but tends to be used for larger scale analytical queries. We have been transitioning to using Presto to power our data platform and customer-facing scripting language, RQL (Rippling Query Language) to run arbitrary customer queries to power core products. Presto helps enable diverse, federated querying at scale. In this talk, Andy will cover where Presto sits in Rippling’s ecosystem as a core query layer, our collaboration and contributions for closer integration with Apache Pinot, and learnings on using Presto to handle a large variety of query patterns.",

    "description": "Shared Foundations Of Composable Data Systems - Biswapesh Chattopadhyay, Google\n\nData processing systems have evolved significantly over the last decade, driven by various factors such as the advent of cloud computing, increasingly complexity of applications such as ML, HTAP, Streaming, Observability and Graph processing. However, historically, these frameworks have evolved independently, leading to significant fragmentation of the stack. In this talk, I will talk about how this has evolved in the open source and at Meta, and how we are solving this problem through the Shared Foundations effort, leading to composable systems. This has resulted in significantly better performance, more features, higher engineering velocity and a more consistent user experience.",

    "description": "How to Speed up your Lakehouse Queries by an Order of Magnitude with Multi-modal Index Subsystem using Apache Hudi and Presto. - Sivabalan Narayanan, Onehouse\n\nApache Hudi brought transactions, incremental processing on top of data lakes, which are deemed as the foundational pillars for Lakehouse architecture. In this session, we will discuss Apache Hudi and how it fills the key technology gaps in the modern data architecture. Viewed from a data engineering lens, Hudi also plays a key unifying role between the batch and stream processing worlds realized by incremental processing model. We will take a look at the capabilities of native Hudi connector in Presto. We will dive deep into this connector, covering the key optimizations and features it unblocks. Presto users could now leverage the metadata table for optimized file listing and avoid large number of list operations in cloud storages. We will look at how we can improve the query latency in Presto using advanced data skipping methodogies employed with multi-modal sub-system with Hudi.",

Modern object stores are the ideal platform to pair with MPP query engines like Presto - particularly as the scale reaches tens or hundreds of petabytes with tens to hundreds of concurrent queries. In this talk, Satish Ramakrishnan will outline the better together attributes of the two technologies with a focus on the most sophisticated modern object storage features - from throughput optimizations, multi-cloud capabilities, cross-cloud active active replication and lifecycle management. Participants will come away with a reference architecture suited to query processing at object scale.",

This is way less than the ratio of women in tech that various research shows at 26%. Given the amount of investment going into and the growth / success of companies based on open source as well as the enormous demand for developers in open source, it is a ratio we need to strive to improve for women.

This new component encapsulates several critical functions like data modeling, access control, and aggregate awareness while deliberately omitting others, like data visualization and presentation. We'll explore: - Keeping data models separate from data sources and not substituting data modeling with mere data transformation. - Managing access control centrally, aggregate awareness, and caching in a separate layer upstack from data consumers. - Removing data presentation features and embracing data accessibility via a set of APIs.",

We must be able to experiment in production and automate actions while minimizing customer pain and reducing damage to code and data. If your product’s value is derived from data in the shape of analytics or machine learning, losing it, or having corrupted data, can easily translate into pain. In this session, you will discover how chaos engineering principles apply to distributed data systems and the tools that enable us to make our data workloads more resilient. We will also show you how to recover from deploying code that resulted in corrupted data, which can happen with complex distributed data systems with many moving parts.The first problem the industry faced with large-scale of data was the feasibility of processing data at such a high scale. In solving the scale problem, people developed technologies we know today, like Kafka, Spark, Presto, Snowflake, and many others powering big data operations today.Now the problem people face is one of manageability. People no longer ask if they can handle a dataset but rather: How can I move faster when developing data-intensive applications? How do I utilize all of my data and ensure it is high-quality?Learn how to simplify the management of a data lake by enabling git-like operations over files in object storage. See how experimenting, reproducing data and guaranteeing data quality are simplified and are all possible to achieve through open-source tooling.",
