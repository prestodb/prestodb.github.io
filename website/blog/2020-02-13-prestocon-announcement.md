On March 24, 2020 in San Mateo, the Presto Foundation, in partnership with The Linux Foundation, will be hosting the organization’s first-ever [PrestoCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/). The event, one of the first Presto-focused full-day conferences ever held, will feature speakers from Uber, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as tech talks from other major Presto contributors and enthusiasts. 

Presto, a high performance, distributed SQL query engine for Big Data, was originally developed at Facebook to power large-scale data analytics on Apache Hadoop. Open sourced in 2013, the [PrestoDB](https://github.com/prestodb/presto) project was contributed to the Linux Foundation in 2019 to facilitate an [open and neutral governance model](https://prestodb.io/blog/2019/12/16/growing-the-presto-foundation) that has enabled the software to grow and diversify its community of contributors.  

In addition to keynotes and tech talks, PrestoCon will bring together Big Data and analytics practitioners from across the world for a day of networking and collaboration to advance the use of Presto. We will close out the event with a special happy hour for all attendees, providing an opportunity for discussion and socializing.  

For those interested in speaking about their Presto experiences or best practices, we encourage you to [submit a proposal to speak](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/program/cfp/).

Don’t forget to [register](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/Register/) for the event as spaces are limited. We look forward to seeing you there!
