Hello Presto enthusiasts!

We here at the Presto Outreach Committee are absolutely thrilled to be entering the new year of 2023. It's hard to believe that another year has passed, but as we reflect on the past year, we can't help but feel grateful for the amazing growth and progress we've seen in the Presto community in 2022.

From the launch of new features and improvements to the expansion of our user base, it's been an incredible year for Presto. We're so grateful to each and every one of you who has been a part of this journey with us.  Check out some of the impressive stats that we have collected over the past year!

As we look ahead to the new year, we're filled with excitement and anticipation for all that's to come. There's no telling what the future holds, but we have a feeling that 2023 is going to be even bigger and better for Presto. We are especially excited to see expanded support for the Lakehouse ecosystem, and all of the work around the Velox engine for even faster query speeds.

So let's raise a glass (or a mug of our favorite beverage) to all that we've accomplished, and to the bright future ahead. Here's to a fantastic 2023!
